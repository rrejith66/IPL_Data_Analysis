# 📊 IPL Analysis & Insights Dashboard
🏏 Project Overview

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on IPL data to uncover insights about the best batsmen, bowlers, fielders, and most successful teams.
The analysis uses Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) and Power BI for interactive dashboards.

Key Questions Answered:

Who are the best batsmen in IPL history?

Which bowlers consistently perform the best?

Who are the most impactful fielders?

Which team is the most successful across seasons?

# 📂 Dataset

Matches dataset → Contains match-level details (season, venue, winner, toss, etc.)

Deliveries dataset → Ball-by-ball details (runs, wickets, players, dismissal types, etc.)

Source: Kaggle IPL Dataset
 (or any IPL data source you used)

# ⚙️ Workflow

Data Cleaning & Preparation

Removed null/missing values

Handled inconsistent team/player names

Created calculated columns (e.g., outcome type: win by runs/wickets)

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Batsman performance (total runs, strike rate)

Bowler performance (wickets, economy)

Fielding impact (dismissals)

Team success metrics (wins by venue/season)

Visualization

Python (Matplotlib + Seaborn) for EDA plots

Power BI for interactive dashboards

💡 Insights

Best Batsmen

Bar chart shows the dominance of top run scorers (e.g., Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma).

Helps identify consistent performers for brand value & fan engagement.

Best Bowlers

Wickets + economy rate highlight bowlers like Lasith Malinga.

Insight can help franchises in team-building & auction strategies.

Best Fielders

Players with maximum catches/runouts emerge as fielding assets.

Fielding insights improve team defensive strategies.

Most Successful Teams

Teams like MI & CSK dominate in terms of wins.

Positive business impact: higher fan following, sponsorship value.
